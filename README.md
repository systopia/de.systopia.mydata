# MyData extension

CiviCRM extension to allow API access to your own data

**This extension offers API wrappers (get/getsingle/create) for these five
entities:**

* Contact => MyContact
* Address => MyAddress
* Phone => MyPhone
* Email => MyEmail
* Contribution => MyContribution (no updates)
* Membership => MyMembership (no updates)
* CustomValue => MyCustomValue (only get, only a Contact custom fields)
* MembershipPayment => MyMembershipPayment (only create)

They only allow viewing and editing *your own* contact and its associated
address/email/phone/contribution/membership.

The API calls require the `view my contact` and `edit my contact` respectively.
